# TI3150TU Capstone Applied AI project



## Getting started
Introduction:

This repository is for the Capstone Applied AI Project, where the goal is to create an invertible neural network (INN) based on a coupling flow architecture to simulate a preconditioner for solving large linear systems. It learns a preconditioning map based on a synthetically generated Poisson linear system.

In many large linear systems, solving them becomes less of an issue of complexity, but more of a memory issue. This project aims to reduce the amount of iterations required to reach convergance on an iterative solver such as the Richardson method. 


1. Prerequisites:

    -> Python 3.10+

    -> PyTorch 2.x

    -> NumPy

    -> SciPy

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment as some older versions of packages could be installed, causing issues.

data_generation.py must not be modified

All learning is performed explicitly and manually in model.py

3. Problem Setup

We consider a linear system induced by a Poisson discretization:

𝑣
=
𝐴
𝑤
v=Aw

where:

𝐴
A is a fixed sparse Poisson matrix generated by poisson_gene

𝑤
w is a random input vector

𝑣
v is the resulting residual / observation

The learning task is supervised regression:

model
(
𝑣
)
≈
𝑤
model(v)≈w

This is intentionally not density estimation and does not use likelihood-based losses.

4. Data Generation

Training data is generated using:

from data.data_generation import poisson_gene, gen_vec


poisson_gene(nx, ny) constructs the Poisson operator

gen_vec(dim, samples, A) generates paired samples (v, w) such that:

v = A @ w

w ~ N(0, I)

Inputs (v) are normalized, outputs (w) are not.

5. Models
Supervised INN (Default)

Built from manual affine coupling layers

Alternating split structure (with flipping)

Identity initialization for stability

Trained using MSE loss

Double precision (float64) throughout

This model preserves invertibility structure while being trained purely in a supervised fashion.

Baseline MLP

A standard fully-connected network with the same input/output dimensionality, used for comparison.

6. Training

To train the supervised INN, simply run:

python model/model.py


Key training details:

Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimizer: Adam

Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau

Precision: float64 (mandatory)

Batch training with shuffling

Progress is printed every 10 epochs.

7. Evaluation

After training, the script automatically:

Generates a fresh test sample

Applies the same input normalization

Predicts 
𝑤
^
w
^

Reports test MSE

Example output:

Final Test MSE: 1.2e-06

8. Usage

After training, the model can be used as:

w_pred = model((v - v_mean) / v_std)


where v_mean and v_std are the statistics computed during training.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
